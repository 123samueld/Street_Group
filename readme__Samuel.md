// Note to Street Group reviewer(s)
I made a huge error when I mis-read the question. Based on the term "may
choose to create ... a simple class" I thought all functionality had to be built into 1 class. Therefore what I felt should have been 2 model classes and a controller have all been crammed into a single class. Sorry. But by the time I realised my mistake I was 99% finished without the energy or enthusiasm to start again from scratch. 

// Getting Started
This was built using Laragon but MAMP, XAMP, WAMP, LAMP or similar 
setups should suffice to run the app. Simply load the index.php file in your localhost and everything is handled from there.
